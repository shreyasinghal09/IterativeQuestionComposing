A regular pentagon has fivefold rotational symmetry, which means that it can be rotated by 360 degrees divided by 5, or 72 degrees, and still appear the same.\n\nSince we want to find the minimum number of degrees, we can start by rotating the pentagon by 72 degrees. This will rotate the pentagon by one-fifth of a full rotation.\n\nHowever, we need to consider the orientation of the pentagon. If we rotate the pentagon by 72 degrees, it will be rotated by one-fifth of a full rotation, but it will also be rotated by one-fifth of a full rotation in the opposite direction.\n\nTo find the minimum number of degrees, we need to add the two rotations together.
